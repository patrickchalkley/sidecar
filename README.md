# Sideshow

Sideshow is a minimalist jacket for [Simplify](http://mmth.us/simplify/) that showcases cover art, designed for large secondary displays such as an LCD TV.

Sideshow currently supports a black colour scheme and displays artwork at 800px. You can click anywhere within the jacket bounds to play/pause.

## Credits
Sideshow is a remix of the excellent [Sidecar](https://github.com/ttscoff/sidecar) jacket by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/topic/sidecar/). This would not have been possible without Brett’s hard work.
